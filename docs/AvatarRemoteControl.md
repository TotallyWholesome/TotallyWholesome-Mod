# Remote Parameter Control

The remote parameter control system allows you to mess with your pet(s) advanced avatar parameters remotely, do note that the pet has to enable the parameters to allow the master to see and mess with them.

## For Pets
The setup for a pet is pretty simple, from the main TW tab you can choose Avatar Remote Config, once in there you'll see a list of all the avatar parameters that you can enable. You can currently select up to 6 of those parameters. Once you do you can back out of that menu and the selected parameters will be saved, enabled parameters are saved per avatar, so once you configure it once they'll stay like that.

## For Masters
The usage for masters is very simple, once your pet has enabled some parameters for you to control. All you need to do is go to the TW Tab, select Individual Pet Controls, choose the pet you'd like to mess with and choose Avatar Param Control. Once you're in the Avatar Param Control menu you'll see the parameters your pet has enabled and can mess with them all you'd like.

## Caveats
There are currently a couple of limitations to be aware of with the Avatar Remote Control system.

* You can only enable 36 parameters to be controlled right now, this may change down the road
* Floats are handled a bit weird, the slider values are only sent when you close the Avatar Param Control menu, they also go from -1 to 1, so if the avatar expects 0 to 1 it may not work as expected when below 0
